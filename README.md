The code for the benchmark is available in the `Benchmark` folder.

The seed data required to run the benchmark is available on the `occupancy.itu.dk` server. Pinars user has a copy of the seed data in her user-folder.
Alternatively, the `Scripts` folder contains the python-script used to extract the seed data from the ITU data set. To retrieve your own copy, supply the script with:
- The url of the influx server storing the ITU data
- Credentials for a user with read-access to the `occupancy` database.
